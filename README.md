# Selenium Webdriver with TestNG - Practice

## This repository contains the practice files used throughout the courses that are part of the Fullstack Selenium in Java 

Every part of this project is an example from the courses that guided me on how to do the following:

* Java Basic/ OOP/ Collections
* Selenium WebBrowser/ WebElement
* Practice on the TestNG framework
